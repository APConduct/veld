# Test calling the same generic function with different types - simplified version

# Define generic identity function
let identity = fn<T>(x: T) -> T => x

# Call identity with different types - each should get fresh instantiation
let int_result = identity(42)
let string_result = identity("hello")

# Return one result to verify it works
int_result
