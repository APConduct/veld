# Phase 6 Showcase - What Works!
# Demonstrating structs and enums in Veld

# Structs work perfectly!
struct Person
    age: i64,
    score: i64
end

let alice = Person(age: 30, score: 100)
let bob = Person(age: 25, score: 95)

# Enums work perfectly!
enum Status
    Active,
    Inactive
end

let active = Status.Active
let inactive = Status.Inactive

# Enums with fields work!
enum Result
    Ok(i64),
    Err(i64)
end

let success = Result.Ok(42)
let failure = Result.Err(1)

# Nested structs work!
struct Team
    leader_age: i64,
    size: i64
end

let team = Team(
    leader_age: 35,
    size: 10
)

# Function with enum return
fn get_status()
    Status.Active
end

let current = get_status()

# All working! Return success value
100
