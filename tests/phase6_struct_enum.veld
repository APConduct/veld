# Phase 6 Test: Struct and Enum Operations
# Testing basic struct and enum functionality

# Test 1: Basic struct declaration and creation
struct Point
    x: i64,
    y: i64
end

let p1 = Point(x: 10, y: 20)

# Test 2: Struct field access
let x_val = p1.x
let y_val = p1.y

# Test 3: Nested struct
struct Rectangle
    top_left: Point,
    width: i64,
    height: i64
end

let rect = Rectangle(
    top_left: Point(x: 0, y: 0),
    width: 100,
    height: 50
)

let rect_x = rect.top_left.x

# Test 4: Basic enum declaration
enum Color
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue
end

# Test 5: Enum with fields
enum Shape
    Circle(i64),
    Rectangle(i64, i64)
end

let circle = Shape.Circle(10)
let square = Shape.Rectangle(20, 20)

# Test 6: Tuple creation
let tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
let tuple2 = ("hello", 42, true)

# Test 7: Simple pattern matching (commented out until pattern matching is ready)
# match circle
#     Shape.Circle(r) => r,
#     Shape.Rectangle(w, h) => w * h
# end

# Return test result
x_val + y_val + rect_x
