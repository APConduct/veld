# Phase 6 Test: Comprehensive Enum Operations
# Testing enum variant creation with fields

# Test 1: Simple enum with no fields
enum Status
    Pending,
    Active,
    Complete
end

let s1 = Status.Pending
let s2 = Status.Active
let s3 = Status.Complete

# Test 2: Enum with single field
enum Shape
    Circle(i64),
    Square(i64),
    Rectangle(i64, i64)
end

let circle = Shape.Circle(10)
let square = Shape.Square(20)
let rect = Shape.Rectangle(30, 40)

# Test 3: Enum variants as function returns (no type annotations)
fn make_circle(radius)
    Shape.Circle(radius)
end

fn make_square(side)
    Shape.Square(side)
end

let c1 = make_circle(5)
let sq1 = make_square(15)

# Test 4: More complex enum
enum Result
    Ok(i64),
    Err(i64)
end

let success = Result.Ok(42)
let failure = Result.Err(1)

# Test 5: Enum in struct
struct Container
    status: Status,
    shape: Shape,
    value: i64
end

let container = Container(
    status: Status.Active,
    shape: Shape.Circle(25),
    value: 100
)

# Test 6: Nested enum creation
let nested = Container(
    status: Status.Complete,
    shape: Shape.Rectangle(10, 20),
    value: 50
)

# Test 7: Enum as variable that can be reassigned
var current_status = Status.Pending
current_status = Status.Active
current_status = Status.Complete

# Return test value to verify execution
# Since we can't pattern match yet, just return a constant
200
