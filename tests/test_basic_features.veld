# Basic test for new compiler features
# Tests compound assignments and multi-value returns

# Test 1: Basic compound assignment
var x = 10
x += 5

# Test 2: All compound operators
var y = 100
y += 20
y -= 10
y *= 2
y /= 4

# Test 3: Compound in loop
var sum = 0
var i = 1
while i <= 3 do
    sum += i
    i += 1
end

# Test 4: Simple multi-value return
fn get_pair() => (10, 20)
let pair = get_pair()

# Test 5: Three values
fn get_triple() => (1, 2, 3)
let triple = get_triple()

# Test 6: Mixed types
fn get_mixed() => (42, "hello", true)
let mixed = get_mixed()

# Test 7: Empty tuple
fn get_unit() => ()
let unit = get_unit()

# Test 8: Combine both features
fn calc(n) => do
    var total = 10
    total += n
    (total, total * 2)
end
let result = calc(5)

# Success!
var done = true
