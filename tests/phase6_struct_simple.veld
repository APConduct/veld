# Phase 6 Test: Simple Struct Operations
# Testing basic struct functionality without tuples or enums

# Test 1: Basic struct declaration and creation
struct Point
    x: i64,
    y: i64
end

let p1 = Point(x: 10, y: 20)

# Test 2: Struct field access
let x_val = p1.x
let y_val = p1.y

# Test 3: Another struct with different values
let p2 = Point(x: 5, y: 15)
let p2_x = p2.x
let p2_y = p2.y

# Test 4: Nested struct
struct Rectangle
    top_left: Point,
    width: i64,
    height: i64
end

let rect = Rectangle(
    top_left: Point(x: 0, y: 0),
    width: 100,
    height: 50
)

# Test 5: Access nested struct fields
let rect_x = rect.top_left.x
let rect_y = rect.top_left.y
let rect_w = rect.width
let rect_h = rect.height

# Test 6: Compute a result
let sum = x_val + y_val + p2_x + p2_y + rect_x + rect_y + rect_w + rect_h

# Return test result (should be 10 + 20 + 5 + 15 + 0 + 0 + 100 + 50 = 200)
sum
