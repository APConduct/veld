# Phase 6 Test: Enum Operations (No Type Checking)
# Testing enum variant creation without type annotations

# Test 1: Simple enum with no fields
enum Status
    Pending,
    Active,
    Complete
end

let s1 = Status.Pending
let s2 = Status.Active
let s3 = Status.Complete

# Test 2: Enum with single field
enum Shape
    Circle(i64),
    Square(i64),
    Rectangle(i64, i64)
end

let circle = Shape.Circle(10)
let square = Shape.Square(20)
let rect = Shape.Rectangle(30, 40)

# Test 3: Enum variants as function returns (no type annotations)
fn make_circle(radius)
    Shape.Circle(radius)
end

fn make_square(side)
    Shape.Square(side)
end

let c1 = make_circle(5)
let sq1 = make_square(15)

# Test 4: More complex enum
enum Result
    Ok(i64),
    Err(i64)
end

let success = Result.Ok(42)
let failure = Result.Err(1)

# Test 5: Enum as variable that can be reassigned
var current_status = Status.Pending
current_status = Status.Active
current_status = Status.Complete

# Test 6: Multiple enum instances
let status_list = [Status.Pending, Status.Active, Status.Complete]

# Test 7: Enum with multiple fields
enum Point3D
    Origin,
    Point(i64, i64, i64)
end

let origin = Point3D.Origin
let point = Point3D.Point(10, 20, 30)

# Return test value to verify execution completed
# Since we can't pattern match yet, just return a constant
