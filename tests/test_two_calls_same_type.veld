# Test calling the same generic function twice with the same type
# This should work to verify basic generic instantiation

# Define generic identity function
let identity = fn<T>(x: T) -> T => x

# Call identity twice with integers - same type
let result1 = identity(42)
let result2 = identity(100)

# Return one result to verify it works
result1
