#| Simple test to debug 'as' parsing issues

# Test 1: Basic record casting (this worked)
let record1 = { x: 10, y: 20 }
let point1 = record1 as { x: i32, y: i32 }

# Test 2: Plex declaration
plex Point = { x: i32, y: i32 }

# Test 3: Simple plex casting (this should work)
let record2 = { x: 10, y: 20 }
let point2 = record2 as Point

# Test 4: Check access
let x_val = point2.x
