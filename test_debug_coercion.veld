#| Simple debug test to isolate the coercion issue

# Test 1: Basic plex declaration
plex Point = { x: f32, y: f32 }

# Test 2: Simple variable with matching types (should work)
let point_exact: Point = { x: 10.0, y: 20.0 }

# Test 3: Simple variable with coercion needed (this is failing)
# let point_coerce: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 }

# Test 4: Access the working point
let x_val = point_exact.x
