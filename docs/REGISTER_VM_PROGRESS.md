## Current Work Log

### 2024-12-XX: Phase 3 - Integration Testing SUCCESS! 🎉✅

**Integration Testing Complete:**
- ✅ Created 30 end-to-end integration tests
- ✅ Tests exercise full pipeline: Veld source → Lexer → Parser → AST → RegisterCompiler → Bytecode → VM

- Fixing issues: 1 hour
- **Total: ~1.75 hours from problem to solution**

### 2024-12-XX: Phase 3 Compiler COMPLETE! 🎉🚀

**Completed register-based compiler implementation:**
- ✅ Created `compiler_v2.rs` with RegisterCompiler structure
- ✅ Integrated RegisterAllocator for register management
- ✅ Designed expression-to-register compilation model
- ✅ Implemented ExprResult type to track temp vs variable registers
- ✅ Added comprehensive compilation methods for:
  - Literals, identifiers, binary ops, unary ops
  - Function calls, array/tuple/struct literals
  - Control flow (if/while/for/match)
  - Variable declarations and assignments
  - Lambdas and function declarations
- ✅ **Fixed ALL AST compatibility issues** (~139 errors resolved!)
- ✅ **Fixed ALL ChunkBuilder API mismatches**
- ✅ **Fixed VeldError construction**
- ✅ **All 59 tests passing** including new compiler_v2 tests

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. **Expression Compilation Model:**
   - Each expression compiles to a target register
   - Returns `ExprResult { register, is_temp }` to track ownership
   - Temporary registers are freed after use
   - Variable registers persist in scope

2. **Variable Management:**
   - Variables get fixed register assignments via RegisterAllocator
   - `VarInfo` tracks register, mutability, and scope depth
   - Shadowing supported through allocator's scope stack

3. **Scope Handling:**
   - `begin_scope()` / `end_scope()` mirror RegisterAllocator
   - Variables removed when scope ends
   - Register allocation cleaned up automatically

4. **AST Compatibility:**
   - Matched all actual AST variant names and field names
   - Handled `is_public` fields in declarations
   - Proper Argument enum handling (Positional/Named)
   - All binary operators mapped correctly

**Bug Fixes & Refinements:**
- Fixed `self.chunk.build()` move issue with `std::mem::replace`
- Added `Literal::Unit` → `Constant::Nil` mapping
- Corrected all ChunkBuilder method signatures
- Proper jump patching with `patch_jump()`
- Jump instructions use correct methods (`jump_if_not`, `jump_back`)

## Key Decisions Made

### Instruction Encoding
**Decision:** Fixed 32-bit instruction format
**Rationale:** 
- Simpler to implement and debug
- Fast decoding
- Can optimize to variable-width later if needed
- Larger bytecode acceptable trade-off for initial implementation

### Register Count
**Decision:** 256 registers per frame (u8 indexing)
**Rationale:**
- Matches Lua's design (proven to be sufficient)
- Fits in single byte operand
- Enough for most functions
- Can extend later if needed

### Immediate Constants
**Decision:** Include immediate variants (AddK, MulK, etc.)
**Rationale:**
- Reduces constant pool pressure
- Faster for common small constants
- Lua-style optimization

### Calling Convention
**Decision:** Register window style (like Lua)
**Rationale:**
- Efficient parameter passing
- Natural tail call optimization
- Well-proven design

## Performance Targets

Based on Lua's transition and academic research:

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Execution Speed | 25-35% faster than interpreter | Literature average |
| Bytecode Size | <20% larger than stack-based | Acceptable trade-off |
| Memory Usage | Similar or better | Fewer stack allocations |
| Compilation Time | <10% slower | Register allocation overhead |

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Each instruction tested independently
- Register allocator tested thoroughly
- Edge cases (overflow, nil, errors)

### Integration Tests
- Full programs compiled and executed
- Comparison with tree-walk interpreter results
- Closure and upvalue edge cases

### Performance Tests
- Benchmark suite vs interpreter
- Benchmark vs old stack VM (if kept)
- Memory profiling
- Hot path identification

---

## Risk Register

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Status |
|------|----------|------------|--------|
| Register allocation bugs | High | Extensive testing, follow Lua | Monitoring |
| Performance not meeting targets | Medium | Early benchmarking, profiling | Monitoring |
| Closure complexity | Medium | Follow Lua design closely | Monitoring |
| Integration issues | Low | Incremental integration | Monitoring |
| Timeline overrun | Low | Phased approach, can ship incrementally | Monitoring |

## Questions & Decisions Needed

### Open Questions
- [ ] Should we keep old stack-based VM for comparison?
  - **Recommendation:** Yes, during transition period
  - **Action:** Keep as `bytecode_v1` module
- [x] Do we need end-to-end testing before Phase 4?
  - **Answer:** YES! Integration testing revealed critical AST issues
  - **Action:** Fix issues before proceeding to Phase 4
- [ ] Should compiler handle BlockExpression or should parser change?
  - **Current:** Parser generates BlockExpression for `do...end`
  - **Options:** 
    1. Add BlockExpression handler to compiler (quick fix)
    2. Change parser to generate BlockScope (better long-term)
  - **Recommendation:** Quick fix now, refactor parser later

- [ ] Variable-width vs fixed-width instructions?
  - **Decision:** Fixed-width for now
  - **Rationale:** Simpler, can optimize later

- [ ] Maximum function size limits?
  - **Recommendation:** 256 registers, 64K instructions
  - **Rationale:** Matches Lua, sufficient for most code

### Resolved Decisions
- ✅ Register count: 256 per frame
- ✅ Instruction format: 32-bit fixed
- ✅ Include immediate variants: Yes
- ✅ Calling convention: Register windows

---

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. ✅ All existing test suite passes
2. ✅ Performance is 25-35% faster than tree-walk interpreter
3. ✅ All language features work (closures, pattern matching, etc.)
4. ✅ Bytecode size is reasonable (<20% larger)
5. ✅ Code is well-documented and maintainable
6. ✅ No functionality regressions
