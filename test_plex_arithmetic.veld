#| Test arithmetic operations on coerced plex values

# Test basic plex declaration
plex Point = { x: f32, y: f32 }

# Test automatic coercion from i32 to f32
let point1: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 }
let point2: Point = { x: 3, y: 4 }

# Test arithmetic operations on coerced values
let dx = point2.x - point1.x
let dy = point2.y - point1.y

# Test more arithmetic
let sum_x = point1.x + point2.x
let product = dx * dy

# Test with different numeric types
plex MixedPoint = { x: f64, y: i64 }
let mixed1: MixedPoint = { x: 10, y: 20 }
let mixed2: MixedPoint = { x: 5, y: 15 }

# Test arithmetic on mixed types (should work after coercion)
let mixed_dx = mixed2.x - mixed1.x
let mixed_dy = mixed2.y - mixed1.y

# Final result should be a computed value
product
